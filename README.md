# joomla-typehint-classes
This file helps some IDE's like NetBeans, Eclipse to use type hints autocompleting in joomla projects.
Because joomla has classmap.php where classes are registered and in project used aliases of classes, IDE's can't suggest class paths and autocomplete or go to the class or methods declarations.
After putting the file classes.php which is placed in folder predefined, to any include path or project folder, IDE's can use joomla typehints and autocompleting.
