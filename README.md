# joomla-typehint-classes
The most popular IDE's like (netbeans, eclipse, phpstorm) have autocompletion and type hint support for many framework and cms excluding Joomla.
This file helps some IDE's like NetBeans, Phpstorm, Eclipse, etc... to use type hints autocompletion in Joomla projects.
Because Joomla has file classmap.php where classes are registered and in project used aliases of classes, IDE's can't suggest class paths and autocomplete or go to the class or methods declarations.

### Usage:

Put the file classes.php which is placed in folder predefined, to your project folder after that IDE's can use Joomla typehints and autocompleting.
